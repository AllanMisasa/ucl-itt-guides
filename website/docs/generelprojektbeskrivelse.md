### 1.	Table of Contents

Self-explanatory. 

### 2.  Problem statement

A short and descriptive statement of what the project will be about, and what questions you seek to answer. The problem statement must be clear and unambiguous.

### 3.	Introduction

An elaboration on the problem statement of approximately Â½ to 1 full page. 

Example topics:

* How are you going to build it? 
* Why are you building it?
* Who will use the product?

### 4.	Main Topics

Here students will go into details about their solutions. Below is a non-exhaustive list of topics you can use, but feel free to add onto the list as you please. 

The topics in **bold** are mandatory, the rest you can omit if you want to. 

* **Use cases with use case diagram(s).**
* **Brainstorming results.**
* **Project schedule (Kanban or Gantt for example).**
* Risk analysis.
* **Requirements analysis with FURPS**, MoSCoW, Kano and others as optional addons.
* Milestones with diagram.
* SCRUM: How you used it, and results of meetings.

### 5.	Hardware 

Hardware used and how they relate to functional requirements, diagrams, circuits (remember to describe your figures).

### 6.	Software

Code examples with description. Remember that the full code needs to be in the Appendix, but you are allowed to take snippets that will go into the report body; they will just have to be described and be used sensibly. There must be a reason for including them in the body.

### 7.	Theory

A brief theory section that covers the important topics and concepts that are required or useful knowledge in terms of the construction or usage of the product. 

### 8.	Methodology

Think of this as the section that explains step-by-step how to construct and program your system. 

### 9.	Results

Present your results in a comprehensive manner.

### 10.	Discussion

Results are discussed here. Evaluation is done here and you can present suggestions for future work or improvements.

### 11.	 Conclusion

Remember conclusion is linked to introduction. Here everything that was presented in the introduction has to be touched and concluded upon based on the results from Discussion.

### 12. Limitations

This is an optional section that presents various caveats or limitations, for example to explain why the prototype is not ready for consumers.

### 13.	Literature

List of literature and references.

### 14.	Appendix

Full code, large images, etc.

### 15. Figures

For example pictures, diagrams, hand-drawn pictures, etc. Must be numbered. For example Figure 1, 2, 3... Then you can simply refer to figure x inside the report.
